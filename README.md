# Assortment Data Quality Analysis - A Business Case

This project focuses on analyzing and resolving discrepancies between product data stored in the internal Product Information Management (PIM) system and the user-facing Catalog tool. The goal is to ensure consistency between the two systems, improve data accuracy, and prevent future issues. The project involves analyzing the product assortment, developing a resolution strategy, proposing preventive measures, and creating an implementation plan.

The dataset provided was previously anonymized for privacy reasons.

## Project Goals
Analyze Discrepancies: Identify inconsistencies between the PIM and Catalog systems, including overrides, incorrect images, outdated titles, and other errors.

Resolve Issues: Develop a structured approach to address and resolve identified discrepancies.

Prevent Future Errors: Propose measures to avoid similar issues in the future.

Implement Solutions: Create an operational plan to execute the resolution strategy using available resources.

## Tasks Completed
1. Product Assortment Analysis
Identified the number of partners in the assortment.

Calculated the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) share.

Analyzed the extent of overrides and discrepancies (e.g., correct titles with incorrect images).

Provided insights into the current state of the product data.

2. Resolution Approach
Defined a step-by-step project management process to resolve discrepancies.

Prioritized key areas for resolution based on the analysis.

Visualized the approach in a structured and clear manner.

3. Preventive Measures
Proposed a plan to prevent future discrepancies between the PIM and Catalog systems.

Suggested improvements to workflows, team collaboration, and system updates.

4. Implementation Plan
Outlined an operational process to address discrepancies using available resources:

Operational Support Agents: Assigned tasks for data validation and correction.

Local Teams: Collaborated with partners to ensure alignment and accuracy.

Defined roles and responsibilities for each team to ensure efficient execution.

## Deliverables
Analysis Report: A summary of the product assortment analysis, including key metrics and insights.

Resolution Strategy: A structured plan to resolve discrepancies, visualized for clarity.

Preventive Measures: A proposal to avoid future issues, focusing on system and process improvements.

Implementation Plan: An operational approach detailing how resources will be utilized to execute the resolution strategy.

## Tools and Methodologies
Data Analysis Tools: Python

Presentation Tools: Google Slides.

## Next Steps
Execute the Implementation Plan: Begin resolving discrepancies using the outlined operational process.

Monitor Progress: Track the resolution process and ensure alignment between the PIM and Catalog systems.

Review Preventive Measures: Implement proposed improvements and monitor their effectiveness over time.

Document Learnings: Record insights and lessons learned for future reference.
